***   NECESSITY OF MICRO HYDRO POWER
    Before reading about the necessity of \micro-hydro, Let define \micro-hydro first
    - *\micro-hydro* : It is a renewable source of energy which refers to the conversion of energy 
from flowing water to electricity which is produced in small scale, affordable, power upto *100KW*.

Here are some point why we it is necessary
 + Highly efficient.
 + High level of *predictability*.
 + Long Lasting 
 + Less impact on Environment.
